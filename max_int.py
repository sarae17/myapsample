#During your implementation, 
# make sure you do git status, git add, and git commit regularly.
#When you have finished your implementation:
#Create a public repository on github
#Follow the instructions under "push an existing repository from the command line"
#Push your changes to the remote repo with: git push
#Inspect your commits on github
